# Railway Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Deploy AI Code Assessment System to Railway

Railway is the easiest way to deploy your FastAPI application. No complex configuration, no WSGI issues, just connect and deploy!

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Railway account (free at railway.app)
- OpenAI API key

## Step 1: Deploy to Railway

### Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up/Login** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Select your `codecheck` repository**
5. **Choose the `railway-clean` branch**
6. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Detect it's a Python/FastAPI app
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Start your app with `python main.py`
   - Assign a public URL

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **In Railway dashboard, go to your project**
2. **Click on "Variables" tab**
3. **Add these environment variables:**

   | Variable | Value | Description |
   |----------|-------|-------------|
   | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `your_actual_openai_api_key` | Your OpenAI API key |
   | `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `your_secure_password` | Admin panel password |
   | `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./ai_assessment.db` | Database connection |
   | `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` | `production` | Environment flag |

## Step 3: Test Your Deployment

1. **Visit your Railway URL** (something like `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)
2. **Test the upload page:** `https://your-app-name.railway.app/upload`
3. **Test the admin panel:** `https://your-app-name.railway.app/admin`
4. **Test the API docs:** `https://your-app-name.railway.app/docs`

## Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings"**
2. **Click "Domains"**
3. **Add your custom domain:** `codecheck.website`
4. **Update your DNS** to point to Railway's provided CNAME
