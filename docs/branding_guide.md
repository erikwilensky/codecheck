A. Headings / Primary text
Ensure all headings & button labels use Navy #002855, not #000.
For small labels (e.g., Grade chip) switch to #4F529B Medium weight to stay brand-consistent but readable.
B. Body copy
Switch Bootstrap grey (#6c757d) to #333333 or Switzer Light #4F529B (60 % opacity) to meet AA contrast.
C. Buttons
Primary buttons: Navy background, white text.
Hover/active: background #FF8F1C; text still white.
Outline buttons: Navy border & text; hover invert to navy fill / white text.
D. Progress bars
Physical = #78D5E1, Service = #008A60, Skill = #4F529B.
Ensure bar background is a very light tint of the same hue (e.g., #E7F6F9 for teal).
E. Leaderboard medal colours
Gold #FFB81C, Silver #C0C0C0, Bronze #CD7F32 ‚Äì currently correct.
For rows beyond top-3 use Navy text with subtle tinted background (#F4F7FB) to break the monotony.
F. Card backgrounds
Keep white but add a 2 px top border in Navy (#002855) for visual hierarchy, or apply the triangular divider element mentioned in the Brand Guide to section headers.
G. Scrollbar styling (optional)
Custom scrollbar track #f1f1f1; thumb navy (#002855) that darkens on hover; aligns with brand and improves feel.
